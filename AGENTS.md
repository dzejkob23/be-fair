# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repository.

## Read This First

Read [`README.md`](./README.md) for human-oriented product and project context.

## Module Placement — apply before creating or moving any file

`README.md` describes module purpose and high-level structure; use the rules below when you need an implementation-level placement decision.

Decide placement explicitly *before* writing code, not after. The one hard rule:

- **`core` only holds code consumed by more than one target.** In practice the server consumes only **DTOs, models, constants, and pure domain logic** from `core` — it has no Compose UI, no Ktor *client*, and no secure storage. So "shared with the server" almost always means *a data class*, not client infrastructure.
- **If the server will never use it → `app/shared`** (Android/iOS). **If mobile will never use it → `server`.**
- **Smell test:** if you must write a stub/no-op `actual` for a target that never uses the code (e.g. a JVM `TokenStorage` the server ignores), it's in the wrong module — move it to `app/shared`.

| What you're adding | Module | Source set |
|---|---|---|
| Shared between mobile **and** server | `core` | `commonMain` |
| Mobile domain / data / model only | `app/shared` | `commonMain` |
| UI components (composables) | `app/shared` | `commonMain` under `ui/` |
| Server-only logic | `server` | `main` |
| Platform-specific implementation | `core` or `app/shared` | `androidMain` / `iosMain` / `jvmMain` |

When in doubt: if the server will never need it, it belongs in `app/shared`. If mobile will never need it, it belongs in `server`. Only genuinely shared multi-target code belongs in `core`.

## Source Set Rules

- Prefer `commonMain` for cross-platform logic.
- Put platform APIs into `androidMain`, `iosMain`, or `jvmMain`.
- Use Kotlin `expect`/`actual` for platform abstractions.
- Keep tests in `commonTest` when behavior is shared.

## Dependency Injection

Use the project's manual dependency containers:

- `core/.../di/CoreContainer.kt` — shared instances (e.g. `httpClient`).
- `app/shared/.../di/AppContainer.kt` — mobile-specific instances, wraps `CoreContainer` (exposed as `coreContainer`).
- Container provided to composables via `CompositionLocalProvider(LocalAppContainer provides container)`.
- Accessed in composables via `LocalAppContainer.current`.

```kotlin
// Correct — access via CompositionLocal
val container = LocalAppContainer.current
val repo = container.profileRepository

// Wrong — instantiate directly in a composable
val repo = ProfileRepositoryImpl(httpClient) // breaks DI, untestable
```

## Version and Dependency Source of Truth

Use `gradle/libs.versions.toml` for versions and plugin aliases.

## Gotchas

- `BeFairTypography()` is a `@Composable` function (loads Inter via Compose resources) — call it only inside composition, never assign to a top-level `val`.
- The `primary-fixed` color families in `Color.kt` are standalone `val` declarations, not part of `lightColorScheme`/`darkColorScheme` — they do not adapt between light/dark mode.
- `LocalAppContainer` uses `staticCompositionLocalOf` and errors if no value is provided — every composable tree must be wrapped with the provider in `App.kt`.
- `expect fun getPlatform(): Platform` lives in `core` with `actual` implementations in `androidMain`, `iosMain`, and `jvmMain` — not in `app/shared`.
- `HttpClientFactory` follows the same `expect`/`actual` pattern in `core` across all three platform source sets.
- `SERVER_PORT` lives in `core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/jakubzika/befair/Constants.kt` — reference it by name, never hardcode a port.
- Repositories expose observable state as `StateFlow<T>` backed by a private `MutableStateFlow`, and mutations as `suspend fun` — never return raw values from a repository.
- `UserProfile` currently lives in `app/shared` (mobile-only), not `core` — move a model to `core` only once the server actually consumes it.

## Boundaries

### Always do
- Use `gradle/libs.versions.toml` for all dependency versions.
- Wire new dependencies through the DI containers (`CoreContainer` or `AppContainer`).
- Validate changes with the smallest relevant test or build command.

### Ask first
- Adding a new Gradle module or changing `settings.gradle.kts`.
- Introducing a new third-party library.
- Changing the DI container structure or `CompositionLocal` setup.
- Modifying GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/`).
- Altering the Ktor server routing or serialization setup.

### Never do
- Hard-code hex color values in composables.
- Instantiate repositories or data sources directly in composables — use the DI container.
- Add platform-specific code to `commonMain`.
- Place mobile-only or client-only code (secure storage, Ktor client/auth config, Compose, anything that imports Android/iOS or only the app uses) in `core` — it is for genuinely multi-target code only.
- Modify generated or build output directories.
- Remove or rename existing public API without confirming no other module depends on it.
- Skip the version catalog and add raw dependency coordinates in `build.gradle.kts`.

## Agent Workflow Expectations

- Make minimal, targeted edits; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Keep module boundaries intact.
- Before creating or moving a file, state its target **module + source set** and justify it by **which targets consume it**. If the answer is `core`, re-read [`core/AGENTS.md`](./core/AGENTS.md) first.
- If requirements are ambiguous, state assumptions briefly in your response.
- Update documentation when behavior or workflow changes.

## Safe Change Checklist

Before finishing, verify:

1. Code is in the correct module and source set.
2. Imports/dependencies align with existing version catalog usage.
3. Relevant tests/build commands pass for touched modules.
4. New composables use `MaterialTheme.*` tokens, not hard-coded values.
5. New dependencies are wired through the DI container, not instantiated inline.
6. Documentation is updated when behavior or workflow changes.

## Sub-Module Guidance

Each module has a scoped `AGENTS.md` with rules specific to that area. Read it when working in that module.

| Module | File |
|---|---|
| `core` | [`core/AGENTS.md`](./core/AGENTS.md) |
| `server` | [`server/AGENTS.md`](./server/AGENTS.md) |
| `app/shared` UI layer | [`app/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/jakubzika/befair/ui/AGENTS.md`](./app/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/jakubzika/befair/ui/AGENTS.md) |
